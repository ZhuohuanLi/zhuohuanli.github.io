I am a PhD student at Rutgers University, pursuing my degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering under the guidance of Professor Narayan Mandayam, with co-advisor N.K. Shankaranarayanan. My academic journey began at Rutgers, where I completed both my undergraduate and master's studies, focusing on advanced research in Wireless, Adversarial Attacks, Mobile Networks, and Next-Gen Energy Efficiency.

At WINLAB, Rutgers University, I am actively involved in pioneering research projects. Collaborating with a diverse group of scholars and industry partners(NTIA, ATNT, EURECOM), I am dedicated to exploring and developing innovative technologies for next-generation communication systems. My research interests encompass low-power sensor hardware, end-to-end systems, and network optimization to enhance performance and reduce costs.

Prior to my PhD, I developed a solid foundation in electrical and computer engineering at Rutgers, igniting my passion for unraveling the complexities of modern communication networks.

Experiences
======
- Research Intern at WINLAB, Rutgers University, Jun 2020 -- Aug 2020 <br>
• Project: Self-Driving Vehicular Project
• Assemble and train miniature autonomous vehicles to run in the miniature smart city environment.
• Design and implement self-driving algorithms using machine learning libraries in python. 
• Design behavior that will allow the vehicles to react realistically to other cars and props in the smart city environment, and work with the testbed infrastructure to use external data from the intersection to improve performance.

- Research Intern at WINLAB, Rutgers University, Jun 2021 -- Aug 2021 <br>
• Project: Recognition of Radio Devices using Machine Learning
• This project seeks to use machine learning to recognize different wireless devices. 
• The project will use software defined radios (SDR) to record various devices, such as iPhone, bluetooth earbuds, and Wifi laptops. 
• These recordings will become the training data to a set of neural networks. The second part of the project will quantify the accuracy of the neural networks in classifying various device types based on their RF signatures.
